SSH, a.k.a Secure Shell, is a kind of network protocol for secure data communication. SSH is also very powerful for secure data transfer, e.g. proxy, port forwarding, etc. 

==== Setup a Proxy Using a Remote Host ====
If we have an ssh account YourUserName to a remote host pc that have public IP XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX and ssh port XXXX, then we can set the remote host as a proxy host, and surf the internet via this proxy. 

Under windows
    plink.exe YourUserName@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX -P XXXX -C -D 127.0.0.1:9999
Under linux
    ssh YourUserName@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX -p XXXX -D 127.0.0.1:9999
Then a proxy is setup, which can be used via SOCKET:localhost:9999. 



==== SSH authorized keys ====
<code bash>
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# [AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys]
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_aaa
# [press enter twice]
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_aaa.pub <username>@<remotehost>
# []
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa_aaa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# [on server]
cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa_aaa.pub ~/.ssh
# [on client]
</code>
