==== Local Supercluster Galaxies ====

Local Supercluster (LSC) was first recognized as a dynamical entity abouy 50 years ago by Gerard deVaucouleurs. 

LSC might also be referred to as The Virgo Supercluster.

The Virgo Supercluster is centered at our Milky Way and includes Virgo Cluster, Fornax Cluster and Eridanus Cluster. 

The Virgo Supercluster is within 100 million Light Years (30.66 Mpc) (z_Hubble < 0.008) according to the link below.

The Virgo Supercluster is within 110 million Light Years (33.73 Mpc) (z_Hubble < 0.0082) according to the link below.

LSC might also be referred to as a larger volume than Virgo Supercluster. 

LSC is centered at the Virgo cluster, and includes Coma Supercluster, Leo Supercluster, Sextans Supercluster, and 3 voids: Bootes Void, Carpricornus Void, and Sculptor Void. 

LSC can be as large as 1 billion Light Years (306.60 Mpc) (z_Hubble < 0.08).
