The sinc function is defined as

    sinc(x) = sin(πx)/πx for x different from 0;
    sinc(x) = 1 for x = 0. 

The name "sinc" is shorthand for cardinal sine. The function sin(x)/x (for x different from 0...) is often denoted Sa(x), but is only a scaling of the sinc function.

Solving 
    sinc(x) = 0.5
we get
    x = 1.89549
