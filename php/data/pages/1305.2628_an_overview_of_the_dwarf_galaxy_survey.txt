==== Introduction ====
  * <fc #008000>(remaining problem of dwarf galaxy studies)</fc>
  * establishing the role of dwarf galaxies is one of the keystones ...
  * the ambiguity of dwarf galaxies is that hierarchical models put dwarf galaxies forward as crucial building blocks ... yet dwarf galaxies have much younger stellar populations ... (Maiolino et al. 2008)
  * how genuinely young galaxies ... are related to chemically young galaxies is not at all clear
  * new wavelength coverage as well as spatial resolution and sensitivity provided by Herschel has made it possible to study in detail ...
  * <fc #008000>(feasibility and brief introduction of the project)</fc>
  * before Herschel, much of what we gleaned of the details of dust and gas ... limited mostly to Galactic studies
  * ISO and Spitzer ... proven successful in demonstrating the importance of MIR to FIR observations to study the ... gas ... unusual dust properties in ... dwarf galaxies (e.g. Engelbracht et al. 2005; Madden et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2006; Engelbracht et al. 2008)
  * systematic statistical surveys ... spanning a wide variety of galactic physical parameter space ... can be used to analyze in detail ... only with such studies can we understand the impact of galactic properties on processes controlling the evolution of galaxies
  * to this end, the Herschel Dwarf Galaxy Survey (DGS) ... using PACS and SPIRE onboard HSO ... 48 dwarf galaxies ... also ... 2 more SMC and LMC in SHINING
  * <fc #008000>(varying properties of this sample)</fc>
  * DGS sample has also Spitzer MIR photo and spec (Bendo et al. 2012b) ... create a rich legacy for the community to perform dust and gas analyses ... LIR ranges 6.6e7 to 1.6e11 ... SFR ranges 7e-4 to 28 ... metallicity spans ... 
  * <fc #008000>(spatially resolved properties of this sample)</fc>
  * DGS obtains detailed spatial information on nearby ... The well-resolved objects serve as anchors between the detailed local physical processes and the larger statistical sample ... includes PACS spec maps in LMC and SMC which complement HERITAGE (Meixner et al. 2010, Meixner et al 2013)
  * <fc #008000>(future follow-up studies)</fc>
  * DGS along with ancillary data ...  provides the community with an unprecedented database of high impact legacy value and will lead to many future follow-up studies ... NGC6822 (Galametz et al. 2010; Carlson et al. 2013) NGC1705 (O’Halloran et al. 2010) NGC4214 (Cormier et al. 2010) Haro11 (Cormier et al. 2012) LMC/N11B (Lebouteiller et al. 2012) NGC4449 (Karczewski et al. 2013) ... full photometric and spectrometric results will be presented in Remy-Ruyer et al. 2013 in prep. and Cormier et al. 2013 in prep. respectively. 
  * <fc #008000>(outstanding questions which can be addressed with DGS)</fc>
  * //Global Properties and Diagnostics//
  * The effects of galaxy metallicity, star formation properties, ISM morphology, dust properties, etc on the observed SED
  * In which environment does the submm excess manifest? What is the nature of this submm excess?
  * How can we most accurately trace the total molecular gas reservoirs? Is warm molecular gas a significant component in star forming dwarf galaxies? How reliable the CO-to-H2 conversion factors are?
  * How can we calibrate the technique of using observed dust masses to get the gas reservoirs?
  * Is [CII] 158 μm a valid star formation tracer in local galaxies? Can it be applied to high-z galaxies?
  * //The Impact of Star Formation on the ISM//
  * Feedback of star formation sites to the surrounding metal-poor ISM
