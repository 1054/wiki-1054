This is our small project called SpireLines. 
We investigate the molecular emission line data that mostly observed by the Herschel/SPIRE instrument. 


====== Molecular Emission Lines ======
Molecules and atoms are everywhere in the Universe. The most abundant atom is H, and the most abundant molecule is H$_2$. 
In galaxies, most molecules and atoms are in gas phase instead of solid phase, that is to say, most non-dark matter are in the gas. Some of those matter are in thousands Kelvin hot gas phase which are usually locked in stars, circumgalactic medium and intergalactic medium; others are in tens Kelvin cold gas phase which are usually locked in molecular clouds. Only in cold gas phase can molecules be alive, because under hot temperature they will break into atoms, neutral or ionized. 

We are especially interested in molecular gas. Molecular clouds are like the clouds in our atmosphere, or troposphere, but the real reason is that molecular clouds are the birthing place of stars in all galaxies. They are cold enough so that part of gas can be densified and irreversibly collapse and finally ignite the nuclear hydrogen fusion, which is, a newly born main-sequence star! 

We started to observe molecular gas much later than the stars, because stars emit most their energy in optical light as thermal emitters, but the cold molecular clouds are not thermal emitters. They are dark. One method to measure them is through the extinction of stellar light. Another method is using molecular emission lines. 

Molecules are not still, but always in three kinds of motions: rotation, vibration, and vibrational-rotational motion. The status of each motion is quantized: e.g. for rotation, the energy level is denoted as J, while for vibration, the energy level is v. Transitions between different energy levels would emit or absorb photons with typical energy, thus are quite useful for molecular gas studies. 

In galaxies that have plenty of molecular gas, all kinds of molecules collide with each other, and are also exposed to stellar light photons. The most abundant molecule is molecular hydrogen (H$_2$), and the second abundant molecule is carbon monoxide (CO). H$_2$ molecules requires very high excitation conditions compared to CO molecules, thus CO molecules have much stronger emissions than the most abundant H$_2$ molecules. Observationally, CO rotational emission lines in radio to submillimitre wavelengths are the most powerful diagnose tool for us to study the molecular gas in galaxies. 



====== Herschel SPIRE Instrument ======
Herschel, a great 3.5m infrared space telescope launched in 2009, has 3 science instruments on board: PACS, SPIRE, and HIFI. 
PACS performs photometry at 70, 100, 160 μm, and spectroscopy within 55-210 μm range [[http://herschel.esac.esa.int/Docs/PACS/pdf/pacs_om.pdf|1]]. 
SPIRE performs photometry at 250, 350, 500 μm, and spectroscopy within 194-671 μm range [[http://herschel.esac.esa.int/Docs/SPIRE/pdf/spire_om.pdf|2]]. 

The spectrometer of SPIRE, also named FTS, covers a continuous 194-671 μm (447-1550 GHz) wavelengths (frequencies), which covers plenty of molecular emission lines, e.g. a full CO ladder of $4 \le J_{upper} \le 13$ lines, [CI]($3p_1-3p_0$)($3p_2-3p_1$) lines, [NII]($3p_1-3p_0$)(205μm) line, H2O($2_{1,1}-2_{0,2}$) lines, etc.

====== Use SPIRELINES to Study Molecular Gas in Galaxies ======
===== Sample =====
  - The preliminary sample
    - We preliminarily select all galaxies observed by FTS
    - and have molecular lines detections
  - The selected sample
    - We use FIR to trace SFR of galaxies. Thus we select galaxies only in the RBGS (Sanders 2003) for now. 
    - We need to match the FTS beam sizes and FIR photometry aperture, thus we use PACS photos to do the correction.
