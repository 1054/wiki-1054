===== Astronomical Deep Fields =====
Longer time we integrate, deeper sky we see. This is mostly true. Thus to probe the most distant and faintest galaxies hidden in the sky that do not want to be seen because aliens live in there, we must integrate for a long long time, toward the so called deep fields. 

There are several deep fields in the sky that have been observed by many most advanced telescopes in the world, one of the most famous deep field is the two Hubble Deep Fields (HDFs). The HDFs were carefully selected to be free of bright stars, radio sources, nearby galaxies, etc., and to have low Galactic extinction (Ferguson, Dickinson & Williams 2000 ARA&A), to be observed by the most advanced optical to near-infrared space telescope so far -- the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The HDF North (HDFN) field observation was taken in December 1995 and the HDF South (HDFS) in October 1998. Both were reduced and released for study within 6 weeks of the observations. Many groups followed suit and made data from follow-up observations publicly available through the world wide web  (Ferguson, Dickinson & Williams 2000 ARA&A). The area of sky covered by HDFs are small: 5.3 arcmin^2 for HDFN and 0.7 arcmin^2 for HDFS. Till the year 2000, in HDFN, around 3000 galaxies were identified in the optical bands and around 1700 galaxies in the near-infrared bands (Ferguson, Dickinson & Williams 2000 ARA&A).
